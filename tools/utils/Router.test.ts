    * This Router module primarily integrates middlewares, sets up routes, and 
    * configures the app with various configurations. While it's possible to 
    * mock and test each middleware addition and the configuration, doing so might 
    * not provide significant value.
    * 
    * Most of the logic in the Router module is directly related to Express.js 
    * behavior, which we assume is already tested by the Express.js team.
    * 
    * The real-world behavior and integrations of this router setup would be more 
    * appropriately validated through integration or E2E tests, where you can 
    * check if routes are responding as expected, if CORS headers are set, etc.
